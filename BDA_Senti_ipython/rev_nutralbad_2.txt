I liked the look of this case at Best Buy versus the other they had available at the moment. I purchased this because I needed a case immediately and didn't want to risk carrying my new phone around with one. It seems like a study case and somewhat protective however it does not fit perfectly. It slides a little up and down in the case. The fit is fine left to right. I would probably look elsewhere for a case if I were you.
