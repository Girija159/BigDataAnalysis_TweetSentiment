I also ordered this via the campaign, with the expectation that it would work on my Motorola HD RAZR MAXX phone, which has SW Version 4.1 loaded. However, it does not and only works for limited Android phones. There's a blog written by people who have had mostly bad experiences with the sticker. For some people even if it does work on their phone/iPad, it doesn't work accurately. Also, not all the stickers worked when received.
I was told via the company's Facebook page that they are coming up with an application that would work on my phone. We'll see.
Until then, I would put off ordering this until the bugs are worked out.
