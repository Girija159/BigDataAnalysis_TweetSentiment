The company sent me 2 of this product and they both were not able to charge or sync my idevices. This Apple product is very high tech it actually has a chip that verifies the phone and the cable. The customer service was outstanding when dealing with the replacement of the product. I would buy from this seller again just not an apple product that has such high tech specifications. You get what you pay for.
