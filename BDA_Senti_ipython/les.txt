This is an example of great writing. The style, pace, characters, descriptions, settings, action--all of it. It's great. I read this book in a literature class and really enjoyed it. It is perhaps the best classic I have read besides Tolkien's The Hobbit. Treasure Island manages to stand alone as the go-to book on pirates, sea voyages, and young men seeking adventure. Before anyone decides to read children's or YA literature, they must first read Treasure Island to get an idea of what a good book should contain.
Question: Why haven't they made a modern movie of this? It would be great cinema.
