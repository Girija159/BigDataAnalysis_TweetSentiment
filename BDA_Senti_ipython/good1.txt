Like others, I was part of the funding campaign. Great idea, but either the execution or the technology is flawed. The product does NOT operate as advertised. I was willing to forgive that the product does not even have the capability to work with my new model android phone, and instead paired the sticker to my wife's iphone. The app installed, I was able to pair the sticker etc. Sounds good right? At least I got further than some of the other reviewers.

Unfortunately, even in completely clear, no obstacle, line of sight, the location function was very poor - 5-10 feet at best - any further and it couldn't locate the sticker at all. When it did connect, it gave inaccurate information as to the distance.

This produce is NOT ready for release. If you buy now, you are funding the second stage R&D and purchasing a product that has promise, but currently simply doesn't function
