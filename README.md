**Tweet**

The configurable fields are:

- consumer_key
- consumer_secret
- access_token
- access_token\_secret

These fields can be retrieved from  [https://dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com) after creating an account and an application

- file_name (name of the `cvs` output file)
- count (number of tweet to download)
- filter (a word used to filter the tweet in output)

The CSV file produced in output can be used as arg of the other three script:

- `DeriveTweetSentimentEasy.py`: This script uses AFINN-111.txt as vocabulary to try to assign a sentiment score to a tweet.
- `NewTermSentimentInference.py`: This script try to assign a sentiment score to the words that are not present in AFINN-111.txt based on the sentiment score of a group of tweets.
